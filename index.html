        <h1>No Knead Bread Recipe</h1>
        
        <p>This "no knead" bread recipe is a very popular one that originated from <cite>Jim Leahy, the owner of Sullivan Street Bakery</cite> and was posted in the <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread" target="_blank">New York Times</a>. What makes this recipe so popular is that it is very easy to prepare, involves no extra kneading, and produces a bread that is light and fluffy with a satisfying crunchy crust. I've made this bread many times and its versatility and ability to modify is exceptional. Want to add rosemary and garlic? No problem!  Want to make an olive bread? Easy! Add 3 varieties of cheese for a savory bread? Your imagination is the limit!    
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 1/3 cups (430 grams) all-purpose or bread flour</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp (1 gram) instant yeast</li>
                <li>2 tsp (8 grams) salt</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (345 grams) water</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Equipment needed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>6- or 8-quart cast-iron pot</li>
                <li>Cutting board</li>
                <li>Large mixing bowl</li>
                <li>2 cotton towels</li>
                <li>Plastic wrap</li>
            </ul>
    <br>
    
        <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>
            <picture>
                <img src="images/flour_640x941.jpg" alt="picture of flour, yeast, and salt being mixed into a bowl" width="600">
            </picture>
        <br>Combine the flour, salt, and yeast into a mixing bowl, add the water, and stir until the contents are mixed together. At this point the dough should be sticky and rough textured. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest for 12-18 hours, but the longer the better. Rest at warm room temperature or about 70 degrees.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Step 2</h2>
        <p>

                <img src="images/dough_600x343.jpg" alt="picture of hands folding dough" width="600">
            </picture>
        <br>When the dough's surface is dotted with bubbles, it is ready to be worked on. Lightly dust a work surface (cutting board) with flour and place the dough on it. Dust with more flour and fold the dough once or twice. Cover again with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.</p>
        <br>
       
        <h2>Step 3</h2>
        <p>
            <picture>
                <img src="images/rising_623x480.jpg" alt="picture of dough wrapped in a towel and rising" width="600">
            </picture>
        <br>Use a light amount of flour to prevent any sticking to the surface and work the dough into a ball shape. Dust a towel (avoid terry cloth if possible) with flour and place with the seam-side down. Cover with an additional towel and let rest for another 2 hours. The dough at this time should double in size and not be springy to the touch.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Step 4</h2>
        <p>
            <picture>

            </picture>
        <br>30-minutes before baking, pre-heat your oven to 450 degrees and let your cast-iron pot warm in the oven. When ready, place the dough seam-side up into the pot and distribute evenly. Cover with a lid and bake for 30 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for an additional 15-30 minutes until brown. Remove from pot onto a cooling rack and let sit as the delicious smell of warm bread fills your house!</p>
